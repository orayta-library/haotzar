# This file provides documentation or notes regarding the assets used in the project.

## Assets Overview

This directory contains all the static assets used in the marketing site for the application. These assets include images, icons, and any other media files that enhance the visual appeal and user experience of the site.

## Asset Guidelines

- **Image Formats**: Use optimized formats such as JPEG for photographs and PNG for images requiring transparency. Consider using SVG for icons and vector graphics.
- **Naming Conventions**: Use descriptive names for asset files to ensure clarity and ease of use. For example, use `hero-background.jpg` for a hero section background image.
- **File Organization**: Organize assets into subdirectories if necessary (e.g., `images`, `icons`, `videos`) to maintain a clean structure.

## Usage

When referencing assets in your components or styles, ensure to use relative paths. For example:

```javascript
import heroImage from '../assets/images/hero-background.jpg';
```

## Future Considerations

As the project evolves, regularly review and update the assets to ensure they align with the overall design and branding of the application.
